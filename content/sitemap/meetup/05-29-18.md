## Introduction

Brief Introduction of new members

## Planning Items

Starting to hit our stride now and meetings for next 2 months are planned.

As mentioned we are always looking for constructive criticism and are currently enacted the two we have already recieved:

* More focused on specific topics
* Don't assume users are familiar with fundamentals

We did also get some positive feedback:

* Videos are great and want more like it
* Appreciate the open source repo examples

Important: A lot of us are on the #cloudnative channel if ever need assistance!

## Minutes

But first we need to quickly go over some highlight from the minutes during the last meetup.

* Review of planning decisions from last meeting
* Website govcloud.ca
* More documentation being pushed to YouTube
* Will cut out planning discussion from video minutes
* Will upload 1.5hrs in chunks
* AKS / ACS (Benefits / Comparisons)
* ACS Engine
  * Take bare minimum cluster definition (small JSON) which then generates ARM templates
  * For operators that need complete control and customizability
  * Deploys cluster on Ubuntu
  * OpenShift support also being added
  * Can add custom extensions (e.g., choco)
* Autoscaler
* Heptio Ark: Must have for any cluster
* VS Code: Many Kubernetes / Helm integration
* JupyterHub and custom developer environments
* Distributed Logging with EFK
* Pachyderm

## Questions

What kind of applications are people consider containerizing?

* Identity management platform (6 services together) - Pat, Public Works
  * Working locally, automated pipeline, test
  * Alpine Linux, a few that are Ubuntu (more for COTS)
  * GitLab CI
* Data science framework (spark, Hadoop, Drupal, etc.) - Will, Statistics Canada
  * Horizontal services that devops can deploy and maintain to support dev groups
  * Private NuGet repo, Jenkins, GitLab, etc.
  * Windows 17.09 or higher (Azure, Kubernetes) due to networking issues
  * Build containers for non-core applications of .NET
* Best ways to set up local:
  * Easiest: Docker for Mac / Windows (currently in edge)
  * Hyperkube, Kubespray
