> Minutes taken by: [Zachary Seguin](https://zacharyseguin.ca)

## Introduction

**Canadian Digital Services - Collaboration Room**

* Canadian Digital Services / Statistics Canada organized
* Importance of Cloud native
* As Developers our view points aren't always appreciated
* Policy makers make decisions and we enact it

## Minutes

But first we need to quickly go over some highlight from the minutes during the last meetup.

* Review of planning decisions from last meeting
* Website govcloud.ca
* More documentation being pushed to YouTube
* Will cut out planning discussion from video minutes
* Will upload 1.5hrs in chunks
* AKS / ACS (Benefits / Comparisons)
* ACS Engine
  * Take bare minimum cluster definition (small JSON) which then generates ARM templates
  * For operators that need complete control and customizability
  * Deploys cluster on Ubuntu
  * OpenShift support also being added
  * Can add custom extensions (e.g., choco)
* Autoscaler
* Heptio Ark: Must have for any cluster
* VS Code: Many Kubernetes / Helm integration
* JupyterHub and custom developer environments
* Distributed Logging with EFK
* Pachyderm

## What kind of applications are people consider containerizing?

* Identity management platform (6 services together) - Pat, Public Works
  * Working locally, automated pipeline, test
  * Alpine Linux, a few that are Ubuntu (more for COTS)
  * GitLab CI
* Data science framework (spark, Hadoop, Drupal, etc.) - Will, Statistics Canada
  * Horizontal services that devops can deploy and maintain to support dev groups
  * Private NuGet repo, Jenkins, GitLab, etc.
  * Windows 17.09 or higher (Azure, Kubernetes) due to networking issues
  * Build containers for non-core applications of .NET
* Best ways to set up local:
  * Easiest: Docker for Mac / Windows (currently in edge)
  * Hyperkube, Kubespray

## Upcoming Presentations

* Next meet up by Laurent (co-maintainer of Node.JS container)
* After that, Zachary with OpenFaaS
* Mark w/ Windows Workloads (.NET, CI/CD, Jenkins, etc.)

## Planning

* Review of planning decisions from last meeting
* Website govcloud.ca
* Documentation on YouTube after its done
* Will cut out planning discussion from last time
* Will upload 1.5hrs in chunks

## AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)

* Downside: cannot customize the master
* Downside: no custom VNETS
* Fixed in ACS engine, and will eventually make its way up to AKS.
* Standard D4s_v3 (16GB RAM, 4 cores) (v3 or higher for nested virtualization)
* Templates are not stored by you (ARM templates, etc.)
* Works in Canada East with 1.9.6 (some extensions have issues)

## Azure Container Service (ACS)

* Exact same as AKS, but gives you the master
* Similar downsides as AKS

## ACS Engine

* Take bare minimum cluster definition (small JSON) which then generates ARM templates
* For operators that need complete control and customizability
* Deploys cluster on Ubuntu
* OpenShift support also being added (changes to 1 line)
* Can add custom extensions (e.g., choco)

## Autoscaler

* Gave a brief demo

## Heptio Ark

* A must-have on any cluster

## Distributed Logging

* EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana)

## Jupyterhub

* https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io

## VS Code

* You can preview templates (Helm: Preview template)
* VSCode has great integration with Kubernetes
